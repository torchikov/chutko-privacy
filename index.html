<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><a href="ru.html">🇷🇺 Версия на русском языке</a></p>

<p>Sergei Torchikov ("Developer") built the <strong>Chutko</strong> app as a Free app. This page informs you of the policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the app.</p>

<h2>1. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All diary entries, emotions, body sensations, and reflections you create in the app are stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. The Developer has no access to your personal entries. No data is uploaded to any server.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email, or any personal identifiers.</li>
    <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
    <li>We do not collect photos, contacts, or other sensitive data.</li>
    <li>We do not require account registration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Analytics</h2>
<p>The app uses <strong>TelemetryDeck</strong> to collect anonymous usage statistics, such as which screens are viewed and which features are used. TelemetryDeck is a privacy-first analytics service that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li>Does not use cookies or device fingerprinting.</li>
    <li>Does not track users across apps.</li>
    <li>Is GDPR-compliant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can disable analytics at any time in the app's Settings.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/">TelemetryDeck's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Data Export</h2>
<p>The app allows you to export your entries as PDF or Markdown files. Exported files are created locally on your device, and sharing is handled through the standard iOS Share Sheet. The Developer does not have access to exported files.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The only third-party service used is TelemetryDeck (described above). No other third-party SDKs, advertising networks, or tracking tools are integrated into the app.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the app, please contact the Developer.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. You are advised to review this page periodically.</p>
